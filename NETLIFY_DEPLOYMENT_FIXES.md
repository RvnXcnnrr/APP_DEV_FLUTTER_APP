# Netlify Deployment Fixes

This document explains the changes made to fix the white screen and MIME type errors encountered when deploying the Motion Detector React app to Netlify.

## Issues Fixed

1. **MIME Type Error**: The browser was expecting JavaScript module scripts but was receiving files with the wrong MIME type ("application/octet-stream").

2. **Missing Vite SVG**: The `/vite.svg` file was not found, resulting in a 404 error.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Netlify Configuration

Modified `netlify.toml` to include proper headers for JavaScript modules:

```toml
# Set proper MIME types for JavaScript modules
[[headers]]
  for = "/*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "text/javascript"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.mjs"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "text/javascript"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.css"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Type = "text/css"

[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
```

### 2. Added Netlify Redirects File

Created a `_redirects` file in the `public` directory to ensure proper routing:

```
/* /index.html 200
```

### 3. Fixed Missing Vite SVG

Updated `index.html` to use an inline SVG data URL instead of referencing an external file:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath d='M12 2C6.48 2 2 6.48 2 12s4.48 10 10 10 10-4.48 10-10S17.52 2 12 2zm0 18c-4.41 0-8-3.59-8-8s3.59-8 8-8 8 3.59 8 8-3.59 8-8 8zm-2-3.5l6-4.5-6-4.5z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E" />
```

### 4. Enhanced Vite Configuration

Updated `vite.config.js` to include better build settings:

```javascript
build: {
  outDir: 'dist',
  assetsDir: 'assets',
  emptyOutDir: true,
  sourcemap: mode === 'development',
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      manualChunks: {
        vendor: ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-router-dom'],
      },
    },
  },
},
```

### 5. Added Custom 404 Page

Created a custom 404.html page to handle navigation errors gracefully.

## How to Deploy

1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. Log in to Netlify and deploy your site
3. If you've already deployed, trigger a new deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check the Netlify Build Logs**: Look for any errors during the build process
2. **Verify Headers**: Use browser developer tools to check if the correct Content-Type headers are being sent
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Try clearing your browser cache or using incognito mode
4. **Check Network Requests**: Use the Network tab in developer tools to see if any resources are failing to load

## Backend Configuration

Remember to also update your backend CORS settings as described in the `BACKEND_UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file to ensure the deployed web app can communicate with your backend API.
